# Plantphenology
Training a model which can identify the changes in a plant that occured with the change of time. In this project I have to check only the 2 stages of plants, whether flowering or non flowering. I have also to further check the 4 stages i.e flowering, vegetative, budding and fruiting. I am using Garlic Mustard plant and the images are taken from INaturalist https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/56061-Alliaria-petiolata/browse_photos. The scientific name of the plant is Alliaria Petiolata.
The packages used are:
